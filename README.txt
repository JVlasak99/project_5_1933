The textScan() method in HashTable.java is written from the TextScan.java file provided to us in the project writeup. Algorithm credit goes to this source.

Secondly, I got the idea for my hash function from Chris Dovolis in Lecture 36, where we went over an example of creating a hash function. I used this idea and added some of my own into it. 

Finally, I got some help for creating the display method (iterating through the actual table) from the following article: https://www.javacodeexamples.com/iterate-through-java-hashtable-example/3149
